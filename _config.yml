    I sometimes stumble on fundamental insights of knowledge have stood the
    test of time and apply across various disciplines. They help me connect
    the dots, make better decisions, or simply understand things more deeply. Some
    call them "mental models"; I like to call them "Universal Bits". Whenever
    this happens, I write my thoughts here. Additionally, I write about
    computer science and all other topics that fascinate me.
