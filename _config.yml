    I sometimes find knowledge that has stood the
    test of time and applies across disciplines. It helps me connect
    the dots, make better decisions, or simply understand things more deeply. Some
    call it "mental models"; I like to call it "Universal Bits". Whenever
    this happens, I write my thoughts here. I also write about
    computer science and whatever topic captures my curiosity.
