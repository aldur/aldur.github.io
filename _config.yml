    I sometime _stumble_ on fundamental insights of knowledge that stood the test
    of time, apply across different disciplines, and help me connect the dots,
    make better decisions, or simply _understand_ things. Some like to call them
    "mental models", I call them "Universal Bits". Whenever that happens, I write
    about it here. I also write about computer science and all other topics that
    fascinate me.
