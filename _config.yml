    Sometimes, I'll find knowledge that has stood the test of time and applies
    across disciplines. It helps me connect the dots, make better decisions, or
    simply understand things more deeply. Some call it "mental models"; I like
    to call it "Universal Bits" and I write about it here. You will also find me 
    writing about computer science and any topic that captures my curiosity.
