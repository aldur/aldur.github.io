## Who am I?

I'm a computer science master student @ Sapienza, University of Rome.
I'm enrolled in the Network and Security field.
My interests vary from distributed computing to crypto, passing through IoT, machine learning and cyber-security.

I'm currently studying the [Ripple Distributed Ledger protocol](https://ripple.com/learn/).
Lately I'm also starting exploring the security implications of cloud and remote systems, while performing lot of pentesting practise.

As some of you may have guessed, the name of this blog is a reference to the terrific "[_The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)", by Douglas Adams.
If you still haven't read it, give it a try, it's going to be worth it.

## Selected quotes

> The Grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. What did they look like? Ships? Motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. And then, one day, I got in.
