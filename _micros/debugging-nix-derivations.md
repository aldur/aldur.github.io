A living collection of tips to debug Nix derivations.

## More verbose traces

It is helpful to run `nix build` with the flags `--show-trace
--print-build-logs -v`.

## `breakpointHook`

Instead of stopping when a failure occurs, [`breakpointHook`][0] will let you
attach to the build process (the last line of the logs will print the command
to do that).

```nix
nativeBuildInputs = [ breakpointHook ];
```

It is only available in Linux.

## Tracing all commands

Add `NIX_DEBUG = 7;` anywhere to your derivation (this [works by setting `-x`
on `stdenv`][3] initialization). Can be very verbose.

## Tracing a specific value

[`builtins.trace][4] takes a value, traces it, and returns its second value.

The [`lib.debug`][5] library functions in Nixpkgs provide a few more tools,
e.g. to trace a value based on a condition (`lib.debug.traceIf`) or to trace a
value and return it (`lib.debug.traceVal`).
