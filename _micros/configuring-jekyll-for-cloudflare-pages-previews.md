[Cloudflare Pages][0] previews deployments at
`<branch-or-commit>.<project>.pages.dev`. Those previews are useful to review
content and layout and to test specific features (e.g., OpenGraph integration
and RSS feed/sitemap generation, which can be validated once online through
third party tools). For those features to work correctly, Jekyll needs to know
the `url` at which it is serving its assets.

Cloudflare builders expose the URL for previews through the [`CF_PAGES_URL`
environmental variable][1]. We can make Jekyll aware of it through this
`build_cloudflare.sh` script:

```bash
configs="_config.yml"

if [ -n "${CF_PAGES_URL:-}" ]; then
  echo "url: $CF_PAGES_URL" > _cf_url.yml
  configs="${configs},_cf_url.yml"
fi

bundle exec jekyll build --config "$configs"
```

To run it, set the script as the build command in your Cloudflare Workers and
Pages configuration.
