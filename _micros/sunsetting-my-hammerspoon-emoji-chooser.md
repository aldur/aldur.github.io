title: 'Sunsetting my Hammerspoon emoji chooser'

One of the things I love about writing software for myself is the very low risk
of [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification). The
product will change only if I want it to change. I typically iterate on it
early on and then simply enjoy using it when stable. 

By  having code for _exactly_ what I need and nothing more, I can get away with
minimal dependencies and moving parts. By building on opensource foundations,
self-made software typically requires very little maintenance as well.

Then, one day I look back and discover that I have been using that software for
almost a decade. That is certainly the case for my [Hammerspoon emoji chooser
on macOS]({% post_url 2016-12-19-hammerspoon-emojis %}), dated December 2016. I
used it daily on countless chats and only occasionally updated it to support
new Unicode symbols.

At the time, I built it because I could not find an alternative good enough for
me: with keyboard only navigation, escape to dismiss, quick searching,
hackable. I remember _knowing_ that macOS shipped with an emoji picker, but I
was not fond of it -- it felt clumsy and had only partial keyboard application.

At some point, macOS' emoji picker must have improved. Today, it feels good
enough for my needs. It has a default keybinding to
<kbd>üåêÔ∏é</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> (using Apple's relatively new "Globe"
key), it focuses the search bar, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> accepts selection. That
compares pretty nicely to how I set up my emoji chooser, bound to
<kbd>Hyper</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> (with <kbd>Hyper</kbd> set to
<kbd>‚åÉ Control</kbd> + <kbd>‚å• Option</kbd> + <kbd>‚åò Command</kbd>).

_Hello from the built-in macOS picker_

That's why it is (sad) time to sunset my own implementation. When possible, I
strive for minimalism and try sticking to provided defaults. By using the
built-in picker I can disable Hammerspoon's accessibility access (required to
type the emoji into the corresponding window) and remove one more service from
my stack. If Apple ever messes it up, I can always get my self-made version
back in no time. If you ever need it, you will find it archived {% include
