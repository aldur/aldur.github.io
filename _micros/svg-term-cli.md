title: 'TIL: animated SVGs'

Just discovered [`svg-term-cli`](https://github.com/marionebl/svg-term-cli),
which allows to turn `asciicast` into SVGs. Since I prefer not relying on
external resources, I am now using it [in this post]({% link _micros/pipes.md %})
instead of using a JS embedding pointing to `asciicinema`.
