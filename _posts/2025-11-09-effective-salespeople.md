excerpt: >
  Good sales create mutual wins by managing expectations and honestly defusing
  the negatives.

Nick Huber, in "_The Sweaty Startup_", writes that _sales is the foundation of
every business_.

Having a tech background _and_ being mostly surrounded by other builders, sales
is both one of my weakest skills and one that I want to improve. I've witnessed
great ideas fail because nobody was selling them, disproving the "_build it and
they will come_" myth, and I have seen what a truly good seller can bring to
the table.

To me, good sales boil down to mutual _wins_. A good salesman will figure out
what the other party needs, a way to provide it at a fair price, and manage
expectations, while avoiding deception and the [psychological biases]({% link
_posts/2025-09-08-nuggets-of-psychology.md %}) that trap both buyers and
sellers.

A corresponding section of the book describes a few down-to-earth habits to
become more effective at sales. I found them particularly valuable because they
align with good product management or successful _negotiations_. I am writing
them here with a few reflections so that, eventually, they can become part of
my mental models.

##### 1. Realize not everyone wants to buy what you’re selling

Some will never be _your_ users.

This is both true and hard to accept at first, especially when we compare
ourselves to the hyperscaler of the day, or when technology is so pervasive
that almost everyone browses social media through a smartphone.

For those who would be _your_ users, though, remember that [innovation and
adoption take time][0].

##### 2. Get comfortable being uncomfortable

Improving at something requires discovering one's limits and overcoming them,
while facing both the unknown and what's visible around us. Sales require that
same attitude, times a thousand.

Especially when cold-calling or finding an initial market fit, sales are a
numbers game. You will have dozens of conversations, each equally uncomfortable.
Make them worth it: each sale is an opportunity to figure out someone's needs
and an opportunity to adapt your offer.

##### 3. Prove that you are an expert

Experts know about both the upsides and the downsides of an opportunity. They
have been in the trenches, and they know that things can and will go wrong, but
they also recognize the value that an opportunity can provide.

Some salesmen will only try to sell you on the upside, without mentioning the
downsides. This sometimes results in potential buyers getting defensive,
feeling that something is "too good to be true" and that they aren't seeing the
full picture yet. They'll likely stall or simply back out. I know I do, in
those cases.

Instead of hiding risks and difficulties, acknowledge them in your pitch and
show you know how to manage them. Exposing the negative aspects makes them less
frightening. It _defuses_ them while reinforcing what's positive.

##### 4. Manage expectations

_Success_ depends on how you define it. Pick success criteria that you are
_very likely_ to meet, while ensuring to satisfy the customer needs.

The classic examples draw from forecasting how long something will take.
Instead of over-promising on a tight timeline that requires _everything to go
smoothly_, be realistic and think about risks, uncertainties, and unknown
unknowns. Discuss them upfront with your potential buyers. Together, you'll
pick good success criteria.

Those conversations will be hard but necessary to manage _all_ stakeholders'
expectations. Have them early on: you will also find out that _some_ potential
buyers are not the right fit for _you_.

##### 5. Add value first

Business is a positive-sum game. Someone's success will enable them to spend
more, and their spending is going to be someone else's income.

Adding value means _first_ providing something that your users need, so they
can test it and eventually _trust_ you. At that point, the _sale_ becomes a lot
easier.

Successful SaaS companies (e.g., Tailscale) have found a good balance around
this, with a free tier generous enough to suit most needs and a paid tier you
(or your employer) can purchase after finding trust and value in their service.

##### 6. Make scarcity work for you

Not every customer will provide you the same value: 20% of your users might
generate 80% of your sales.

Gently push back potential buyers after you have made it clear that you are an
expert, you know how to manage expectations, and how to add value. You don't
need to win every sale and if you do, your prices are probably too low. It will
be hard because it looks counter-intuitive.

Pushing back allows _you_ to select customers that are right for you, while
turning away potentially bad customers.

##### 7. Let the other party sell themselves

After having _defused_ the negatives and having gently pushed them away, ask
your potential buyer "_What makes you think I'd be a good fit?_".

In negotiations, open ended questions and well-timed silences will allow
information to flow while you discover what the other party needs. In sales,
they'll do something as powerful: they'll change perspective and framing. Then,
the other party will start selling themselves to you, explaining how they'd be
a great fit or a good customer. If that happens, they'll have overcome any
objection they might have had and convinced themselves that they want to work
with you.

##### Closing thoughts

I find that sales, negotiations, and product management share these traits.
They boil down to a few core principles: being upfront and providing true
value. Forecasting what to expect and know what you don't know. Managing
stakeholders' expectations by defusing the negatives and, as a result,
reinforcing the positives. Not everyone will be your user, nor will every user
be right for you. Change perspective and re-frame things to let the other party
sell _to you_. You will learn what they really need and they will work with you
to overcome objections and biases.

How do you approach sales? Have you found yourself nodding along or violently
shaking your head? I'd love to hear about it – shoot me [an email](mailto:{{
