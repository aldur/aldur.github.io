title: 'Why my internet dropped like clockwork'
excerpt: >
  A misconfigured watchdog in my ISP router brought me offline every two hours.
---

I recently upgraded my home network to gigabit internet provided by O2, the
low-cost brand of Movistar Spain. They run fiber to the home ([FTTH][0]) and
lease consumers their routers to convert the optical signal into an electric
one. In my case, I got a Mitrastar HGU router (`GPT-2742GX4X5 v6`, running
firmware `GL_g2.5_100XNT0b23`).

ISP routers come with security and privacy concerns: where possible, I replace
them with alternatives I can customize and control. At home, I already own a
router that supports OpenWRT. It's much better from a security/privacy
standpoint, but it doesn't have an [ONT][1] and so I cannot connect it directly
to fiber.

To fix that, I configured the ISP router in _bridge_ network mode and connected
one of its LAN ports to the WAN on my router. Then, within OpenWRT, I
configured the required [PPPoE credentials][5] and created a VLAN. I got
online, made a few speed measurements, and ensured that everything was working
great.

After some time I noticed that the connection dropped and that the web
interface of the router wasn't reachable anymore. I brushed it off, thinking
that the network would eventually stabilize. But it kept happening! So I dug a
bit more. At first, I thought of a hardware issue (maybe on the fiber line).
Then, I noticed the following pattern:

    _OpenWRT's statistics showed connection drops every two hours, like clockwork._
  </small>
</p>

Drops so predictable likely indicated a software issue. After ensuring that the
issue wasn't on OpenWRT's side, I started looking at the HGU router. Mitrastar
firmwares have a [history][3] of bugs; it is also likely that bridge mode,
isn't as battle-tested as the rest, because few users enable it.

ISP routers can be a mixed bag in terms of debug access. This one is weirder
than usual:

1. User `1234` can `ssh` into the router with a password printed on a label on
   the router's back.
1. By default, `ssh` drops the user into a restricted shell, unless you use
   `ssh 1234@192.168.1.1 /bin/sh` to get a better shell.

```bash
$ ssh 1234@192.168.1.1
1234@192.168.1.1's password:
>ls
Can't find command: [ls]. Type '?' for usage
>?
>?
# Confused at what's going on
<c-d>
$ ssh 1234@192.168.1.1 /bin/sh
1234@192.168.1.1's password:
ls
rom-t
busybox
BusyBox v1.26.2 (2025-06-19 15:12:31 CST) multi-call binary.
...
```

The `1234` user is technically `root`; the shell is based on `busybox` and it
is half-broken: there are no prompts and `ls` doesn't show the full directory
listing. However, it's enough to start digging.

After poking around, I discovered the router configuration at
`/tmp/var/pdm/config.xml`. It refers to a watchdog, which seems to be one of
the customizations that `TELEFONICA` (Movistar's brand in Spain) applied to it:

```xml
<X_TELEFONICA_COM_Watchdog>
  <Enable PARAMETER="configured" TYPE="boolean">1</Enable>
  <PPP>
    <LookupDomain PARAMETER="configured" TYPE="string">hgu.rima-tde.net</LookupDomain>
    <MaxReset PARAMETER="configured" TYPE="uint32">1</MaxReset>
    <AlertAfter PARAMETER="configured" TYPE="uint32">2</AlertAfter>
    <WD_CheckChange PARAMETER="configured" TYPE="uint32">900</WD_CheckChange>
  </PPP>
  <Info>
    <Process PARAMETER="configured" TYPE="string">pppd;ztr69;zebra;ripd;zywifid;igmpproxy;voiceApp;tefdog</Process>
  </Info>
</X_TELEFONICA_COM_Watchdog>
```

The watchdog itself appears to be `tefdog`. When running in bridge mode some of
its health checks likely fail and trigger a restart of the connection. It also
seems to leak memory, which explains why the web interface would become
unreachable after a while. In particular, the list of monitored processes
always includes `pppd`, even though it doesn't run in bridge mode.

To test the hypothesis of a badly configured watchdog, I first tried to `kill`
it and wait. That did not work, because PID `1` would restart it after a few
minutes. Because the file-system on the router is read-only, I couldn't edit
the executable directly. But I could use a bind mount _over_ it:

```bash
echo '#!/bin/sh' > /tmp/tefdog_fake
echo 'exit 0' >> /tmp/tefdog_fake
chmod +x /tmp/tefdog_fake
mount --bind /tmp/tefdog_fake /usr/bin/tefdog
```

At this point, I killed it again, ensured it would not restart, and waited for
a few hours to see if the connection would drop. When it didn't, I knew I had
found the issue!

The bind mount hack, however, wouldn't survive a reboot. After a power loss,
the router would restart and the watchdog would resume killing the connection
every two hours. I kept poking around for ways to persist the change or to
overwrite the router configuration, until I remembered that a router's web
interface typically allows backing up and re-uploading the configuration. In
some cases, modified configurations would also unlock settings not available
through the web interface.

I went ahead, exported the configuration through the web UI, and quickly
discovered that it is encrypted:

```bash
$ file romfile.cfg
romfile.cfg: openssl enc'd data with salted password
```

I mentioned that this router is a bit _weird_, didn't I? `ssh` provides `root`
access, but only if you know which process to launch. You can read the
configuration through SSH, but then the export is encrypted. After a bit more
digging, I figured out where the decryption happens in the firmware:

```bash
/usr/bin/ccc_preload.sh: openssl aes-256-cbc -md MD5 -k $2 -d \
  -in /usr/etc/smt.cfg -out /var/pdm/config.xml
# NOTE: I added the line break for readability.
```

Later on, I discovered where the encryption password is stored and that it's a
`base64` encoding of 24 (random?) bytes:

```bash
$ grep ENCRYPT /etc/MLD_Config.sh
MLD_APPS_ENABLE_ENCRYPT_CONF_FILE_KEY=zRUqIM1VCqPBrlYbf6CXiOZoZwiIAMHJ
# NOTE: this isn't my encryption key, but a similar-looking one.
```

I don't have another router to check whether this password is hardcoded into
the firmware or generated depending on the hardware (e.g., the MAC address).
Out of an abundance of caution, I haven't shared the exact key I found on my
router, but feel free to [reach out](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}) if you are
interested in it.

After testing the decryption key, I modified the configuration by disabling the
watchdog:

While I was at it, I also made a few more changes to disable analytics, prevent
the router from phoning home, turn off WPS and block [`TR069`][4] at the
firewall level, preventing remote firmware upgrades or configuration changes.

After re-encrypting the modified configuration, I uploaded it, rebooted the
router, and it has since been running smoothly:

  <small>
    _No more drops after the fix!_
  </small>
</p>

To wrap things up, I also dumped the bootloader and the firmware (just in case,
as neither seems to be available online):

```bash
cat /dev/mtd0 > /tmp/bootloader.bin
cat /dev/mtd4 > /tmp/tclinux.bin
md5sum /tmp/bootloader.bin
16fa4cafc4e2c412e053e8757af3d60b  /tmp/bootloader.bin
md5sum /tmp/tclinux.bin
8bb6e6d4e1fb231e4fbb0a98a494ccaf  /tmp/tclinux.bin
nc 192.168.1.3 1234 < /tmp/bootloader.bin
nc 192.168.1.3 1234 < /tmp/tclinux.bin
```

One mystery remains. Why did the drops happen _exactly_ every two hours? I
looked at the router configuration and then had an AI agent look at the
firwmware through Ghidra's MCP. The most convincing explanation (so far) is
that the watchdog performs a check every 15 minutes. After 4 failed checks, it
tries to restart the PPP interfaces (a noop in bridge mode). After 4 more
failed checks, it sends a telemetry event to the ISP's IoT bridge on Azure.
Which, in response, requests a reset of the network stack and temporarily drops
the connection. Here are the relevant parameters from the decrypted
configuration:

| Parameter name | Value | Notes |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---- |
| WD_CheckChange | 900 | seconds, frequency of checks |
| AlertAfter | 2 | how many failed checks before resetting PPP (off-by-one, the decompiled shows it resets when ≥ 3, 0-based) |
| MaxReset | 1 | how many resets to try before notifying upstream |
