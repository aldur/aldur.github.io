How do you find out what's wrong when you have no output and no exit code?

Here is the story of how I solved such problem. No, [it was not DNS][0].

#### Putting things in... Motion

[Motion][1] lets you build DIY motion-detection for various types of cameras.
It allows [pretty extensive configuration][2] through a text-based configuration
file. A few configuration options, e.g. [`on_motion_detected`][3], execute
arbitrary programs or scripts to notify the user of the event.

To make things concrete, the following configuration should log messages into the
system log[^logger].

```bash
video_device /dev/video0

# ... other configuration options setting up the input size, etc.

############################################################
# Script execution configuration parameters
############################################################

# Command to be executed when an event starts.
on_event_start logger "Motion detected!"
```

I happily tried this and... it did not work, no log was printed.

To figure out why, I configured Motion's log to print debug entries. It
confirmed that the event was being detected and the command executed:

```bash
[DBG] [EVT] exec_command: Executing external command 'logger on_event_start'
[INF] [ALL] on_event_start            logger on_event_start
```

But it did not give me any additional clue. So, what next? Being opensource, we
can look at what happens when it tries executing the command:

```c
// https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/blob/8d69cbf27a1c2fcffd7ff0f5558f3e7de277b8d1/src/event.c#L75

/**
 * exec_command
 *      Execute 'command' with 'arg' as its argument.
 *      if !arg command is started with no arguments
 *      Before we call execl we need to close all the file handles
 *      that the fork inherited from the parent in order not to pass
 *      the open handles on to the shell
 */
static void exec_command(struct context *cnt, char *command, char *filename, int filetype)
{
    char stamp[PATH_MAX];
    mystrftime(cnt, stamp, sizeof(stamp), command, &cnt->current_image->timestamp_tv, filename, filetype);

    if (!fork()) {

        /* Detach from parent */
        setsid();

        execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", stamp, " &", NULL);

        /* if above function succeeds the program never reach here */
        MOTION_LOG(ALR, TYPE_EVENTS, SHOW_ERRNO
            ,_("Unable to start external command '%s'"), stamp);

        exit(1);
    }

    MOTION_LOG(DBG, TYPE_EVENTS, NO_ERRNO
        ,_("Executing external command '%s'"), stamp);
}
```

Relatively straightforward[^arg0]: the classic fork-then-exec pattern. Being
able to read `sh`'s exit code or its standard error would be gold to debug this,
but `motion` does not expose them.

Worry not, this just means we can have some fun!

#### Enters `gdb`

I had a suspect that `sh` would tell me more about the problem and I wanted to
somehow convince it to spit its output. I originally thought to replace `/bin/sh`
with a wrapper that would log to file. Feasible, but annoying and likely to
wreak havoc at the system level.

Then, I thought of `gdb`. If we could pause the process execution at the right
time --- right after the fork --- maybe we could redirect the standard error to
a file. Without modifying the `/bin/sh` executable at all.

It [turns out][4] that it is possible, by being clever about how file
descriptors are allocated on Unix and abusing the `print` command in GDB to
evaluate arbitrary espressione.

The snippet below:

1. Hooks `gdb` to the `motion` process.
1. Configures `gdb` to follow the child in case of forks.
1. Sets a breakpoint at the function `exec_command` above.
1. Closes file-descriptor `1` (std-out) and opens a new file descriptor, that
   will be assigned the now-free `1` descriptor.
1. Does the same with file-descriptor `2` for std-out.

```bash
$ sudo gdb -q -p $(pgrep motion) $(which notion)

(gdb) p (int)close(2)
$3 = 0
(gdb) p (int)creat("/tmp/stderr", 0600)
$4 = 2
(gdb) c
Continuing.
```

Et voilÃ ! By peeking at `/tmp/stderr` we have our answer: `logger: command not found`.

#### The smoking gun: NixOS

To understand _why_ things did not work, I need to tell you that I am playing
with NixOS. My Nix configuration runs `motion` through a `systemd` service that
looks roughly like this:

```nix
systemd.services.motion = {
  description = "motion";
  serviceConfig = {
    # The configuration that I am using (not shown here) checks a few more things,
    # that is why it is wrapped in `bash`.
    ExecStart = "${pkgs.bash}/bin/bash -c '${pkgs.motion}/bin/motion -n -c /etc/motion/motion.conf'";
  };
    WantedBy = [ "default.target" ];
};
```

How does NixOS configure the `PATH` of a `systemd` service? [^PATH]

```bash
sudo systemctl cat motion
# /etc/systemd/system/motion.service
[Service]
# ...
Environment="PATH=/nix/store/php4qidg2bxzmm79vpri025bqi0fa889-coreutils-9.5/bin:/nix/store/jjcsr5gs4qanf7ln5c6wgcq4sn75a978-findutils-4.9.0/bin:/nix/store/28gpmx3z6ss3znd7fhmrzmvk3x5lnfbk-gnugrep-3.11/bin:/nix/store/5zjms21vpxlk>
```

It explicitly sets a `PATH` variable that contains all runtime dependencies of
the Nix packages being wrapped into a service --- `motion` and `bash`, in my
case. Of course, Nix has no way of knowing that the configuration requires
`logger`. But we can bring it into the path with the additional `path`
key:

```nix
systemd.services.motion = {
  description = "motion";
  # ðŸ‘‡ this
  path = [pkgs.logger];
  serviceConfig = {
    # The configuration that I am using (not shown here) checks a few more things,
    # that is why it is wrapped in `bash`.
    ExecStart = "${pkgs.bash}/bin/bash -c '${pkgs.motion}/bin/motion -n -c /etc/motion/motion.conf'";
  };
    WantedBy = [ "default.target" ];
};
```

The change fixed the issue and things started to run as expected.

#### Wrapping up

I am sure there are dozens of other ways to debug this and I'd love to hear
them! Reach out if you want to exchange debugging stories. Until next time!

[^logger]:
    Today I learned about the [`logger`
    command](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/logger.1.html).

[^arg0]:
    It took me a while to remember my first-year computer science classes
    and figure out that `sh`, the second argument to `execl`, sets `arg0`.

[^PATH]:
    Before looking at the `systemd` definition, I looked directly a the
    process environment with `sudo xargs -0 -L1 -a /proc/$(pgrep motion)/environ`.
