I recently bought a new LG Nexus 5X, and I was looking for a simple way to
permanently change (*spoof*) the MAC address of the built-in WLAN adapter. It
ships with `Android Marshmallow 6.0.1` and previous guides do not work with it.

Let's get to work.

have successfully used this method without any noticeable problem.

## Requirements

You'll need a `rooted` device and working `adb` access on your machine.
`busybox` is not mandatory, but if you want to follow my exact steps you'll need
it. It also allows making a backup of the previous MAC address. So, go [get
it](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox&hl=it).

## Spoofing

Enable the `USB debugging` on your device, connect it to your PC and check that
everything works as expected.

```bash
¬ª adb devices
List of devices attached
[redacted]  device
```

The WLAN MAC address is stored inside the `/persist` partition of your device.
More info about it can be found [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/general/guide-to-fix-persist-partition-t2821576).

First, take a backup using `tar`:

```bash
¬ª adb shell
shell@bullhead:/ $ su
root@bullhead:/ # cd /persist/
root@bullhead:/persist # ls -la
-rw-rw---- bluetooth bluetooth       17 1969-12-31 20:01 bdaddr.txt
drw-r-x--- input    system            1969-12-31 19:56 calibration
drwx------ system   system            1970-02-11 09:38 data
drwx------ root     root              1969-12-31 19:00 lost+found
-rw-r----- root     system        121 1969-12-31 19:55 sensorcal.json
drwxrwx--- drm      system            1969-12-31 20:01 widevine
-rw-rw---- wifi     system        116 2016-01-03 19:59 wlan_mac.bin
root@bullhead:/persist # tar -zcvf /sdcard/persist_backup.tar.gz .
./
./lost+found/
./data/
./data/sfs/
./data/sfs/U6Gno760ZM24B0p9bVVAfWlpN18_
./data/sfs/ONAfupniDQclyd+6sL8DWUyHKTI_
./data/sfs/Hi8Tz8W0bXUB4uoqPe3f39li2kc_
./data/tz/
./data/tz/tz_counter
./data/tz/tz_counter.bak
./data/app_g/
./widevine/
./widevine/index.txt
./calibration/
./calibration/cnt
./calibration/offset
./wlan_mac.bin
./sensorcal.json
./bdaddr.txt
root@bullhead:/persist #
```

You should now have a backup of the partition, called `persist_backup.tar.gz` in
the root of your `/sdcard`.

Now let's take a look at the `/persist/wlan_mac.bin` file:

```bash
root@bullhead:/persist # cat wlan_mac.bin
Intf0MacAddress=[redacted]
Intf1MacAddress=[redacted]
Intf2MacAddress=[redacted]
Intf3MacAddress=[redacted]
```

I have redacted the actual addresses but you can edit the file (you'll
specifically need to edit the `Intf0MacAddress` line) to your MAC address of
choice. If you are comfortable with `vi`, edit the file in place. Otherwise,
`adb pull` it, edit and then `adb push` it. Remember to fix its permissions
after the push.

After a reboot (`adb reboot`), you'll start using the address.

This way you'll have a fixed MAC address that persists over reboots. If you
prefer to randomly generate a new one, write a small script to replace it by
using something similar to the `/etc/init.d` scripts.

## Bonus: Bluetooth MAC Spoofing

The `/persist/bdaddr.txt` file contains the MAC address of your BT adapter, that
can be spoofed too.
