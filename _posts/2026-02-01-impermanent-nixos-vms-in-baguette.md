  Automatically erasing /home in NixOS VMs.

We have [talked about]({% link _tag_indexes/ChromeOS.md %}) using NixOS to run
VMs under ChromeOS. The VM image doesn't include any secrets and relies on
hardware keys for authentication and signatures (e.g., to push and sign commits
on GitHub). This way, even if the VM was compromised, the hardware-backed
credentials would remain safe.

In practice, though, the VM slowly accumulates other (possibly) confidential
information: source code, [authentication tokens]({% link
_micros/short-lived-openrouter-api-keys.md %}), LLM sessions, and even shell
history. To clean things up, a user would need to periodically destroy and
recreate the VM. But users (myself included) get sloppy, for instance when
overworked. Worse, being in a VM might give them a wrong sense of confidence
that there is nothing to leak!

### What is impermanence

Good safety systems should not rely on user behavior to maintain their safety
properties. Neither should VMs meant to be ephemeral working environments.
Luckily NixOS can help us remediate that.

Due to its reproducibility, NixOS can boot by exclusively relying on a `/init`
file and the `/nix` store[^baguette]. Everything else can be re-created at
runtime (typically, by symlinking files and directories to the appropriate path
in the store). We can _leverage_ that to achieve _impermanence_ and ensure a
clean system after each reboot.

[^baguette]: Pretty much what happens when the [Baguette NixOS image]({%
  post_url 2025-10-29-nixos-baguette-images-in-chromeos %}) starts.

The Nix community has contributed a few ways to achieve impermanence.
Typically, they require configuring the system to erase itself at boot and
maintaining a whitelist that will survive reboots (for instance SSH host keys,
which would otherwise result in a different remote fingerprint at each reboot).

### Erasing `/home`

For the NixOS VMs I use under ChromeOS, I configure impermanence as follows:

- `/home` mounts through `tmpfs`. This way, anything I don't explicitly
  whitelist will be gone at power down. I don't have to worry about automating
  its deletion, but I need to cap `/home` size to (a portion of) the available
  memory.
- The [`preservation`][0] module takes care of safe-keeping a few required
  files and directories under `/home` (for instance known SSH hosts or source
  code I explicitly want to keep across reboots).
- The rest of the filesystem is _not_ impermament, for simplicity and to save
  RAM. My VM user cannot become `root`, so (assuming correct permissions)
  should not be able to modify system files anyways.

### Settings things up

A minimal Nix module to achieve impermanence looks as follows:

```nix
{inputs, ...}:
let username = "aldur"; in {
  imports = [
    # Impermanence: import the preservation module
    inputs.preservation.nixosModules.preservation
  ];

  # Impermanence: tmpfs home with preservation
  fileSystems."/home" = {
    device = "none";
    fsType = "tmpfs";
    options = [
      "defaults"
      "size=4G"
      "mode=755"
    ];
  };

  # Impermanence: whitelist to preserve
  # See `preservation` docs for more configuration options.
  preservation = {
    enable = true;

    preserveAt."/persist".users.${username}.directories = [
      "Documents/"

      {
        directory = ".ssh";
        mode = "0700";
      }
    ];
  };
}
```

### Playing nicely with `home-manager`

While setting things up and testing the result, the VM would occasionally fail
to correctly load `home-manager`'s configuration (which, importantly,
configures the `fish` shell).

After quite some debugging, I figured out that `home-manager` was _racing_
against `garcon`, a service that automatically starts and spawns a shell when a
Baguette VM starts from ChromeOS through `vmc start`. When `garcon` won the
race and executed before `home-manager`, it would launch `fish` without any
customization.

The fix is to delay `garcon` (a user service) until after `home-manager` has
completed:

```nix
_:
let username = "aldur"; in {
  services."user@" = {
    overrideStrategy = "asDropin";
    after = [ "home-manager-${username}.service" ];
    wants = [ "home-manager-${username}.service" ];

    # In case something goes wrong
    serviceConfig.TimeoutStartSec = "90";
  };
}
```

### Wrapping up

I have run with impermanence for a few weeks now and, so far, I haven't had any
issue. With 16GB of RAM, I typically size `/home` to 4GB. I suspect that this
could not be enough to complete artifact-heavy or memory-intensive builds, e.g.
Rust workspaces or numeric Python projects. If that happens, I'll configure the
build tools to store assets in `/tmp`. Similarly, if a project's cache is wiped
on reboot, offline rebuilds would fail (e.g., while on a flight). I avoid that
by relying on `nix develop` for local development shells, which caches
requirements in the `nix` store.

I also see a few security limitations of the approach. Sophisticated malware
could persist through the system configuration or in the `nix` store (to which
my user has write access). Although it isn't a silver bullet, impermanence for
`/home` still adds to defense in depth. It prevents _some classes_ of attacks
(e.g., supply chain compromises) from harvesting credentials that accumulated
over time. I'll continue hardening the VM image against the remaining attacks:
I would love to enable mandatory access control policies, but doing that in
NixOS seems like a deep rabbit hole to explore.
