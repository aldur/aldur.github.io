How migrating from 1Password to iCloud Keychain triggered a bug that spread
to all my Apple devices and how I fixed it.

## The setup: Migrating 1Password to iCloud Keychain

I have been a loving 1Password users for many years, appreciating the UX/UI, its
system-wide integration and its ease of use. Unfortunately, its latest
iterations don't match my needs and disagree with my trust model. Syncing my
encrypted vault to a third party doesn't sound like a good idea, and I'd rather
not have to deal with another Electron desktop app.

I stuck with 1Password 7 for as long as I could. But I knew its time was
coming. Version 8 (the one shipping cloud sync through a subscription model) had
been out for [two
years](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/03/1password-8-for-mac-released/)
already. And version 7 started feeling like being the last one at a party and
being gently asked to leave: it didn't get any new feature (e.g., passkey), and
I worried that at some point it would reach end of life and stop getting
security patches.

So, on a winter morning I decided to migrate to iCloud Keychain for most of the
passwords and a [self-hosted Bitwarden
instance](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) for a few more complex
items[^electron]. This story focuses on iCloud Keychain.

I used 1Password's export function to get a CSV of about 1000 items compatible
with iCloud Keychain import. I stored the file in `ramfs` to avoid forgetting
them on the file-system and worked within a temporarily air-gapped system. I
then went forward and imported the CSV in Keychain. The migration went ok and I
could see the passwords in macOS' built-in password manager.

Browsing felt _great_! I could log into websites without having to juggle
between multiple overlapping autocompletion pop-ups (1Password's, iCloud
Keychain's). So far so good, less painful than I expected.

Happy with the result, I disabled 1Password's browser extension and decided to
keep the application around just in case I had to look up the odd items that did
not correctly migrate[^urls].

## Troubles: cloud-synced performance cores

_Pardon the bad screenshot quality, didn't have enough CPU to make it better._

The silver lining did not last long and troubles began right away. I noticed one
of the M1 Mac _performance cores_ running 100% the `secd` process -- a
"centralized keychain agent" according to `man secd(8)`. `kill`-ing the process
temporarily alleviated the problem, only until it would automatically restart.
Both the Mac's battery-life and performance suffered from it[^impressive].

Like bad news do, troubles also spread fast. In my case, to all other my iCloud
devices.

Opening the "Password" screen on an iPhone or a (dated) iPad started feeling
like navigating through a sea of jelly, where letters typed into the search bar
would filter results slower than your average LLM output. Looking up websites
credentials in the "Password" screen became a frustrating experience. Even
Safari scrolling suffered from this, with the screen moving about 1 third of the
vertical space and then just... stopping. Oh, don't even mention battery life.
Or whether the Watch was affected (probably).

I tried ignoring the problem for a few weeks, hoping it would go away. It did
not, so I set my mind up to solve it.

I started with my usual debugging playbook. Google suggested deleting the local
Keychain store, but I suspected this wouldn't work as my issue spread across
devices[^local]. Next, I tried to take a look at the Keychain itself, but I couldn't,
because the "Keychain Access" app on the Mac froze on start and did not
allow navigating.

Next I decided to look at Console logs[^logs], which dutifully gathered 9K lines of
`secd` logs over 19 seconds (about 500 lines per second):

```bash
» cat secd.logs | grep secd | head -n1
default 09:18:18.073714+0200  SecWarning  com.apple.securityd secd  81301 0xd6a2fa

» cat secd.logs | grep secd | wc -l
    9243
```

## Going in circles: unreasonable items

The very first line caught my eyes. Some item is clearly being _unreasonable_
and maybe that was my clue?

Apple open-sources some of its components, including the Security framework. The
line producing that output is
[here](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Security/blob/0600e7bab30fbac3adcafcb6c57d3981dc682304/keychain/securityd/SecDbKeychainItemV7.m#L600).
The source code does not help much here, but it tells us that _reasonable_ size
is 32KiB.

Is there a way to find the offending items? Keychain Access was not working, so
I ruled it out. But inspecting `secd` through "Activity Monitor" shows a list
of open files:

```bash
# ... snip
/Users/aldur/Library/Keychains/07BF5E04-DAB8-58C9-A0EC-BEB8B068B906/keychain-2.db
/Users/aldur/Library/Keychains/07BF5E04-DAB8-58C9-A0EC-BEB8B068B906/keychain-2.db-shm
/Users/aldur/Library/Keychains/07BF5E04-DAB8-58C9-A0EC-BEB8B068B906/keychain-2.db-wal
# ... snip
/usr/libexec/secd
```

This `.db` file looks promising and its `.db-wal` friends makes it likely to be
an `.sqlite` database. Nice, we can work with that!

```bash
» file /Users/aldur/Library/Keychains/07BF5E04-DAB8-58C9-A0EC-BEB8B068B906/keychain-2.db

/Users/aldur/Library/Keychains/07BF5E04-DAB8-58C9-A0EC-BEB8B068B906/keychain-2.db:

11827, free pages 1818, cookie 0x34e, schema 4, largest root page 187, UTF-8,
vacuum mode 1, version-valid-for 12070
```

Opening the database revealed a set of tables and columns with short,
uninformative names. But the source code and the logs told us the "reasonable"
size and the unreasonable one -- starting from there, I hacked together a quick
Python script to enumerate all entries (in all rows in all tables in the `.db`)
and sort them by descending size:

| Table    | Row  | Column   | Size (bytes) |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------ |
| genp     | 5    | data     | 507933       |
| genp     | 76   | data     | 470066       |
| genp     | 77   | data     | 190289       |
| genp     | 418  | data     | 138309       |
| genp     | 903  | data     | 31318        |
| genp     | 436  | data     | 31301        |
| ckmirror | 2502 | ckrecord | 15920        |
| ckmirror | 119  | ckrecord | 14056        |
| ckmirror | 2451 | ckrecord | 12212        |
| ckmirror | 605  | ckrecord | 11600        |

Our results show that row number 5 of table `genp`, column `data` weights 507933
bytes (half a megabyte). What's in that table? First, the schema:

```bash
sqlite3 /Users/aldur/Library/Keychains/07BF5E04-DAB8-58C9-A0EC-BEB8B068B906/keychain-2.db
SQLite version 3.43.2 2023-10-10 13:08:14

  mdat REAL,
  desc BLOB,
  icmt BLOB,

  labl BLOB,
  alis BLOB,

  persistref BLOB NOT NULL,
  clip INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  ggrp TEXT,
  UNIQUE (acct, svce, agrp, sync, vwht, tkid, musr, ggrp)
);
```

_As I said, not very informative names._

Luckily, there are a few details about each column
[here](https://gist.github.com/0xmachos/5bcf2ad0085e09f3b553a88bb0e0574d). If we
select the protection domain `pdmn` and the Keychain access group `agrp` we can
find out how these ~~keys~~ passwords are used:

```bash
sqlite> SELECT rowid, agrp, pdmn, length(data)
  FROM genp
  ORDER BY length(data)
  DESC LIMIT 5
;
6|com.apple.security.sos|dku|507933
122|com.apple.security.sos|dk|470066
123|com.apple.security.sos|dk|190288
465|InternetAccounts|dku|138009
22034|InternetAccounts|cku|31327
```

Wait, something does not look right. Sure, those are _big_ items. But they
belong to Apple's own `security.sos` Secure Object Sync according to
[this](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/ICloud_Keychain)[^sos], and it's
unlikely my migration messed with them: Apple's [Secure keychain
syncing](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/sec0a319b35f/web)
creates "circles" of devices which share their cryptographic identities and then
use them to circulate the encrypted keychain material. But our first offender
from the table above is marked as `dku`
(`kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly`), which means that particular key
shall never leave the device. Confirmed then, this is not what is causing our
troubles.

Time to go back at digging through the logs.

## The murder weapon

After painstakingly searching through the lines, I saw this:

```txt

```

_Note that it is marked at `default` level, despite being an error. That's why I
couldn't find this when filtering by log level._

Now we are onto something! The next lines look interesting too:

```txt

  with <private> in <SecDbConnection rw open>
```

Overall, this pattern of lines repeats 19 times in the log. Here's what I
_think_ was happening: Keychain was struggling to reconcile two somehow
conflicting items, trying to write them, failing, and repeating the process in a
busy loop. All the time, across all iCloud-synced devices.

So what is causing it?

### The unmasking

<div class="hint" markdown="1">
  Yes, it's a Scooby-Doo reference. 🐶
</div>

I had previously seen [`<private>` log
entries](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging/generating_log_messages_from_your_code#3665948)
before, being part of Apple's unified logging. Since macOS Catalina, we can use
a [configuration
profile](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/systemlogging)
to show the clear-text entries. After
[finding](https://georgegarside.com/blog/macos/sierra-console-private/) and
applying an appropriate `.mobileconfig`, I collected a new batch of logs and
could finally find out the problem: somehow, `github.com` had two conflicting
entries that Keychain could not reconciliate.

This did not fix the problem yet, but I was definitely closer. How to fix it,
though? The `security` command line tool does not work for iCloud Keychain
items; the Keychain Access app was freezing on me. I didn't know of any other
way to remove those entries from the Keychain and I was afraid of modifying the
`sqlite` DB by hand, possibly creating more havoc.

After a while, I noticed that Keychain Access was not _exactly_ freezing, but it
was constantly re-setting its state to a "start" point: That's where it
"clicked": at every iteration of the loop above, at every integrity error, the
app was re-setting. Maybe if I could stop the loop for a moment, I would be able
to search for the entries and delete them?

After some frustrating trial and error I discovered that disconnecting from the
internet, killing `secd`, closing all apps (specifically, Safari was on my
suspects list), I could _barely_ use the Keychain Access app.

The moment I deleted the entries, it all went quiet. The change also immediately
propagated to all devices. I could again search for passwords and fill log-in
information without a hitch.

### The aftermath

With the mystery solved and the problem finally fixed, I was feeling pretty
satisfied.

But I also wondered: how could someone with less patience or technical
inclinations solve this? Our problem was particularly _nasty_ because it spread
across all user devices, was hard to debug on mobile (lacking a clear way to
inspect background tasks), and took a toll on both battery life and performance.
Nothing deal-breaking, but a turn for the worse in digital quality of life.

As an industry, what can we do better to prevent this or to improve its
remediation? As always, there are trade-offs involved. In my case, the migration
from a different password manager caused the bug: something that a _tiny_
minority of users will ever do. And an even small fraction will possibly trigger
the same bug. The trade-off might simply be to let this be, as it is
counter-economical to fix its root cause.

Even if that is the case, I still believe it is important to let users _repair_
their devices (both on the software and the hardware side). The iCloud Keychain
(and more in general the full iCloud suite) lacks proper tooling and
transparency. We should strive to provide good diagnostic, clear run-books, and
ensure they are easily discoverable (as opposed to all useless search results I
found, that will only get worse with
[slop](https://x.com/TomRachman/status/1788324969283273031#)).

This post doesn't have the presumption to do any of that. But at least it
documents the issue and show how I solved it. In case you encounter the same
trouble, I hope your online search will bring you here and show you the
solution.

Thank you for reading and until next time! 👋

#### Footnotes

[^impressive]: I still find it pretty impressive that the M2 would manage to run for a few hours with a core running full-steam all the time.
[^electron]: I didn't manage to escape the Electron hell, since Bitwarden's macOS client isn't native either.
[^urls]: The migration requires entries to have a `URL` assigned to be imported in Keychain. I manually migrated all other entries types (e.g. credit cards, passports, etc.).
[^logs]: I have lightly edited terminal output to display it on multiple lines (e.g., one for the logs metadata, one for the content) to avoid long horizontal scrolling, especially painful on mobile devices.
[^sos]: Different from the more recent addition to iPhones enabling satellite SOS calls on emergencies.
[^local]: Also, I would not even know how to delete it on an iPhone.
