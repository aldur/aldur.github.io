[_Baguette_ 🥖][21] allows running VM images in ChromeOS. It supersedes
[Crostini][22], which used to run containers through LXC, and gives users
better performance and more freedom (e.g., to run Kubernetes without KVM or
access the GPU).

The {% include github_link.html url="https://github.com/aldur/nixos-crostini"
text="`nixos-crostini`" %} repository already includes the magic glue to build
NixOS containers that fully integrate with Crostini. When [someone asked][0]
if it would be possible to support Baguette as well, I peeked at what that
would take. This post describes the results.

<div class="hint" markdown="1">

  _tl;dr_: You can build Baguette images of your NixOS configuration. The
  images provide the same features and UX (e.g., clipboard sharing,
  Wayland/port forwarding, notifications, file browsing from ChromeOS) as the
  default Debian Baguette installs, can be built in CI, and can be fully
  customized to your liking.

## Background: ChromeOS VMs

Under the hood, ChromeOS runs VMs through [`crosvm`][1], a hardened virtual
machine monitor. We already met it when [investigating FIDO2 support in Linux
ChromeOS guests]({% link _micros/fido2-almost-works-in-linux-on-chromeos.md
%}).

Crostini used `crosvm` to run a stripped-down VM called [`termina`][2] that
booted quickly to run the user's containers. It also did a few more things:

1. It mounted [`crosvm-tools`][5] through `crosvm` into a guest directory (and
   later into containers as well).
1. It ran [`vshd`][3], allowing the host to get a shell on the guest.
1. It handled the lifecycle of the VM and of its processes through
   [`maitred`][4].

The [default Baguette image][7] is based on Debian and replicates all this.
In addition, it configures the VM to run `garcon` and `sommelier` (in Crostini
they [run within the container]({% post_url 2025-06-19-nixos-in-crostini
%}#nixos-containers)) to provide URI handling, file browsing, and X/Wayland
forwarding: all those things that make Crostini/Baguette seamless to use
on ChromeOS.

## Baguette NixOS images

Our NixOS Baguette image will replicate the Debian setup. Unlike Debian, NixOS
cannot run [non-Nix executables][8] due to the lack of [FHS][9] and of a global
library path. Luckily, we won't need to worry about that: `crosvm-tools`
include their own libraries and dynamic linker, so they run without issues in
NixOS.

When we built [NixOS LXC images for Crostini]({% post_url
2025-06-19-nixos-in-crostini %}), we learned how to run `garcon` and
`sommelier` at user login. To enable support for `crosvm-tools`, `vshd`, and
`maitred` as well, I added their `systemd` unit definitions.

Booting the VM requires a compressed BTRFS image [built from a rootfs
tarball][10]. To build the tarball through a Nix derivation, I took a page from
the [`lxc-container` NixOS module][11]. Then, to package it:

- I first tried the Python script used by Google, but it depends on
  `libguestfs-appliance`, which is not available for `aarch64-linux` in
  `nixpkgs`[^arm].
- I later switched to QEMU, which works with Nix and supports ARM[^kvm].

[^arm]: I was experimenting with all this on the ARM-based Chromebook that
    I use for couch-computing.

[^kvm]: Because I wanted the build scripts to run within the default `penguin`
    image, I also [overrode the derivation][12] so that it falls back to
    [emulation][13] when `/dev/kvm` is missing.

After transferring the image to the Chromebook's "Downloads" directory, we can
run it from `crosh`:

```bash
vmc create --vm-type BAGUETTE \
  --size 15G \
  --source /home/chronos/user/MyFiles/Downloads/baguette_rootfs.img.zst \
  baguette

vmc start --vm-type BAGUETTE baguette
```

<div class="hint" markdown="1">

  You might have heard of the [`#crostini-containerless` flag][16], which has
  been the default since ChromeOS M147. You don't need to worry about it: the
  command above specifies the `--vm-type`, so it runs regardless. The flag only
  affects what happens when you "Configure Linux" in ChromeOS or use the
  "Terminal" app to launch Linux.

</div>

At boot, `maitred` relies on `/usr/sbin/usermod` to configure users and groups.
`usermod` lives under a different path in NixOS, so I symlinked it there to get
to a shell. _Within_ the VM, I configured the DNS to use the host's resolver and
set the environment variables required by `crosvm-tools`.

X/Wayland and port forwarding were the last pieces of the puzzle. By going
through the source code and the logs, I found out that the `/dev/wl0` device
was missing read/write permissions for non-root users. I fixed it with a quick
`udev` rule, and clipboard sharing and GUI apps started to work. I also created
a `systemd` unit to start `cros-port-listener` and enable automated
port forwarding from Baguette to ChromeOS (very handy when writing this post to
preview it in Chrome).

With our image prepared and all issues fixed, Baguette is ready to shine! The
{% include github_link.html
url="https://github.com/aldur/nixos-crostini/blob/main/baguette.nix"
text="`baguette.nix`" %} file includes the detailed configuration. Here is the
result, showing a `baguette-nixos` VM correctly forwarding a Wayland session to
ChromeOS.

### How-to: Make it yours

Use {% include github_link.html url="https://github.com/aldur/nixos-crostini/"
text="`nixos-crostini`" %} to build Baguette images. If you give it a try, let
me know how it goes through any of the contacts in the footer.

The repository's CI automatically builds the configuration and uploads the image
as a GitHub workflow artifact. Download it to quickly boot Baguette and then
rebuild NixOS from your customized configuration.

If you want to change the default username, fork the repository and edit the
configuration. The CI will rebuild the image for you.

### How-to: Launch NixOS from "Terminal"

The Terminal application defaults to launching a VM named `termina`. To launch
our VM, we will need to replace the default one. From `crosh`:

```bash
vmc stop termina
vmc stop baguette

# Optional: back up `termina`
vmc export termina /home/chronos/user/MyFiles/Downloads/termina.img

# WARNING: This destroys your existing `termina` VM and any data it contains.
vmc destroy termina

vmc export baguette /home/chronos/user/MyFiles/Downloads/baguette-nixos.img

vmc create --vm-type BAGUETTE \
  --size 15G \
  --source /home/chronos/user/MyFiles/Downloads/baguette-nixos.img \
  termina

# Optional: destroy the other `baguette` VM
vmc destroy baguette

vmc start --vm-type BAGUETTE termina
```

The Terminal application will now be able to launch your VM under the legacy
display name `penguin`.

### How-to: USB forwarding

You can forward USB devices to Baguette from Settings → Linux → _Manage USB
devices_:

1. Toggle _Enable persistent USB device sharing with guests_.
2. Enable any USB device you'd like available to Baguette.

Selected devices will automatically be forwarded to Baguette once plugged in.
That's it!

#### How-to: USB forwarding with `crosh`

If you want more control and prefer to enable USB forwarding through `crosh`,
Baguette [simplifies the LXC approach]({% link
_posts/2025-06-19-nixos-in-crostini.md %}#how-to-usb-forwarding) because it
doesn't need a container name.

Insert the device and then navigate to `chrome://usb-internals`. In the
`devices` tab, note the Bus number and Port number of your device.
`dmesg` in `crosh` will provide the same information, if you prefer.

Now open a `crosh` shell and attach the USB device to the VM:

```bash
# Replace <bus> and <port> with the Bus and Port number from above.
vmc usb-attach baguette <bus>:<port>
```

### How-to: Root login

The Debian image allows passwordless `sudo`. The default NixOS configuration in
`nixos-crostini` replicates the approach, so that you can escalate
privileges to rebuild your configuration from within the VM.

I prefer to disable passwordless `sudo` and instead [SSH as `root`]({% link
_posts/2025-06-27-yubikey-root-login.md %}). This way, I can use a hardware key
to prove my physical presence, while an attacker cannot automatically escalate
privileges.

### How-to: Additional `crosh` shell sessions

To get additional shell sessions in `crosh`, use:

```bash
vsh baguette penguin
```

We don't really need the `penguin` argument, but without it we will get the
following error:

> if attempting to connect to a containerless guest please use `vsh termina
  penguin`.

## Conclusion

Getting Baguette and NixOS to work together required some trial and error to
build the image in the right format, figure out a few quirks, and adapt to
ChromeOS's CLI updates. I am pretty happy with the result: I wrote this blog
post from Baguette, and I couldn't tell the difference from legacy Crostini.

I don't run Kubernetes (which seems to be one of the biggest pain points for LXC
users), but Baguette improves a few things for me as well:

1. Besides automatically forwarding USB devices, Baguette does [not hold an
   exclusive lock]({% link _micros/fido2-almost-works-in-linux-on-chromeos.md
   %}) on USB hardware keys, so I can use them _both_ in Baguette and in
   ChromeOS (as a passkey) at the same time without having to fiddle with
   `crosh`.
1. A containerless VM has better access to the underlying hardware and better
   control of its `init`. This might make it easier to implement [ephemeral
   storage][18] and seems to fix an issue with [`pcscd`][20] that would make
   it stop interacting with Yubikeys after a while, until restarted.

Thanks for reading, and 'til next time! 👋
